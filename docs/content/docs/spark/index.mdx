**Spark** is a powerful and flexible templating engine for AdonisJS, designed to make it easy to create dynamic and interactive web applications using [JSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html) without leaving the backend.

```tsx tab="Class components"
export default class SearchUsers {
  query = ''

  render(that: RefAccessor<SearchUsers>) {
    const users = await User.search(this.query)

    return (
      <div>
        <input type="text" $model={that.query} />
        <ul>
          {users.map((user) => (
            <li>{user.name}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

```tsx tab="Async components"
export const UsersList = async () => {
  const users = await User.all()

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <li>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

```tsx tab="Render as JSX"
router.get('/', () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
  )
})
```

**Spark is not React**. It brings its own [JSX runtime](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html) and rendering system built for server-side rendered reactive applications.

## Goals

### Server-first

Even tho Spark provide features for client-side only interactivity and might provide client-side rendering in the future. **Spark goal is to be a server-first framework.**

### Adonis-first

Spark has been built with the idea to become framework agnostic. But its goal is to provide the cleanest possible integration with AdonisJS.

### Simplicity

Modern frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, etc. All create a blury line between backend and frontend creating complexity for newcomers. Spark goal is to be simple with an easy learning curve.

## Alternatives

### EdgeJS

[EdgeJS](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/views-and-templates/edgejs) is the default templating engine provided by Adonis for Server Side Rendering. Being natively supported makes it the first choice for most AdonisJS applications that does not need client-side interactivity.

### Inertia

[Inertia.js](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/views-and-templates/inertia) makes it easy to create Single-Page Apps (SPAs) with React, Vue or Svelte without creating a complete separate frontend app. It allows you to build modern, reactive web applications using classic server-side routing and controllers.
