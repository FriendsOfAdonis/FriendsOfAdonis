title: Actions

Actions are methods on your components that can be called directly from your frontend on user interactions.
It is a really powerful feature allowing you to add interactivity to your application.

Here is a basic example that create a user in your database with a simple click on a button.

```tsx
export class CreatePost extends BaseComponent {
  title = ''
  content = ''

  render() {
    return (
      <form $submit={this.create}>
        <input $model={this.title} />
        <input $model={this.content} />
        <button type="submit">Create</button>
      </form>
    )
  }

  create() {
    const post = await Post.create({
      title: this.title,
      content: this.content,
    })

    this.redirect(`/posts/${user.id}`)
  }
}
```

```tsx
router.get('/posts/create', () => {
  return <CreatePost />
})
```

In this example, when the form is submitted the method `create` is called, creating a `Post` and redirecting the user to `/posts/:id`.

To resume, actions are a way to map user interactivity to server-side functions.

## Event listeners

Osmos provide different event listeners allowing you to call actions when user interact with your application:

- `$click`: When the user click on an element
- `$submit` When the user submit a form
- `$keydown` When the user press a key
- `$keyup` When the user release a key
