title: Head
description: Render elements in the <head/> from anywhere
---

The `<Head />` component allows you to push elements in your document `head` from anywhere.
This is useful when you want to change the "title" of a page for example.

```tsx
export function UsersPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>Users</title>
      </Head>
      <div>
        <UsersList />
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

<Callout type="warn">

As of today there is no duplication prevention which means that you can end up with multiple titles and meta rendered in your `<head/>`
