title: html
description: Render raw unsafe HTML
---

The `html` tag allows you to render raw unsafe HTML. It is similar to `dangerouselySetInnerHTML` prop in React.

<Callout type="warn">

**Be careful when using this**. As this renders raw HTML it is subject to [XSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS) attacks.

</Callout>

```tsx
export const PostContent = ({ content }: { content: string }) => {
  return <article className="prose">{html`${content}`}</article>
}
```

You can also use it to render Javascript.

```tsx
export const RandomScript = () => {
  return <script>{html`console.log("Hello world")`}</script>
}
```
