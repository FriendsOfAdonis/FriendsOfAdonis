title: Best practices
---

To keep consistency in your application organization we recommend following a few set of best practices when working with actions.

## Start with a verb

Name your action classes as concise, explicit phrases starting with a verb. For instance, an action responsible for sending a password reset email to the user could be named SendResetPasswordEmail.

Following this practice, your folder structure naturally becomes a clear catalog of all the features your application offers. This leads us to the next recommended convention.

## Categegorize you actions

When your application start getting bigger you might end up with a really large actions folder.
Don't be scared to categorize them in subfolders, autoloading will still work.

<Files>
  <Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="actions" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="auth" defaultOpen>
        <File name="login_user.ts" />
        <File name="register_user.ts" />
        <File name="reset_user_password.ts" />
      </Folder>
      <Folder name="billing" defaultOpen>
        <File name="create_checkout_session.ts" />
        <File name="update_payment_method.ts" />
      </Folder>
      <Folder name="users" defaultOpen>
        <File name="create_user.ts" />
        <File name="delete_user.ts" />
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>
