title: Action as command
---

Your Actions can be ran as [Commands](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/ace/creating-commands) making them available using `node ace <action>`.

## Implementing `AsCommand`

```ts [title="app/actions/users/delete_user_action.ts"] twoslash
// @noErrors
import User from '#models/user'
import { BaseAction, AsCommand } from '@foadonis/actions'
import { BaseCommand } from '@adonisjs/core/ace'

export default class DeleteUserAction extends BaseAction implements AsCommand {
  async handle(user: User) {
    await user.delete()
  }

  async asCommand({ prompt, logger }: BaseCommand) {
    const email = await prompt.ask('User email')
    const user = await User.findByOrFail({ email })

    await this.handle(user)

    logger.success(`User ${user.id} has been deleted successfully`)
  }
}
```

## Configure command

By default the package will automatically generate a name and a description for your command.

You can change this by setting the properties `commandName` and `description`.

```ts [title="app/actions/users/delete_user_action.ts"] twoslash
// @noErrors
import User from '#models/user'
import { BaseAction, AsCommand } from '@foadonis/actions'
import { BaseCommand } from '@adonisjs/core/ace'

export default class DeleteUserAction extends BaseAction implements AsCommand {
  static commandName = 'users:delete' // [!code ++]
  static description = 'Delete a user from the database' // [!code ++]

  handle() {}
  asCommand(command: BaseCommand) {}
}
```
