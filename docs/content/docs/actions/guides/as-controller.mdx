title: Action as controller
---

Your Actions can be ran as [Controllers](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/basics/controllers) that can be then registered as route handlers.

## Implementing `AsController`

```ts [title="app/actions/users/delete_user_action.ts"] twoslash
// @noErrors
import User from '#models/user'
import { BaseAction, AsController } from '@foadonis/actions'
import { HttpContext } from '@adonisjs/core/http'

export default class DeleteUserAction extends BaseAction implements AsController {
  async handle(user: User) {
    await user.delete()
  }

  async asController({ request }: HttpContext) {
    const id = request.param('id')
    const user = await User.findOrFail(id)

    await this.handle(user)

    return user
  }
}
```

## Registering the route

You can then use your Action as a route handler:

```ts [title="start/routes.ts"] twoslash
// @noErrors
import router from '@adonisjs/core/services/router'
import actions from '@foadonis/actions/services/main'

const DeleteUserAction = () => import('#actions/users/delete_user_action')

router.get('/:userId', actions.asController(DeleteUserAction))
```
