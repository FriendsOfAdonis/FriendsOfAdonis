title: Working with Actions
---

An Action is a self-contained class responsible for performing a single, clearly-defined task within your application.
This promotes modularity, maintainability, and consistency across your AdonisJS project.

## The simplest action

An Action is simply a class with a `handle` method.

```ts [title="app/actions/charge_user_action.ts"] twoslash
// @noErrors
import User from '#models/user'
import { AsAction } from '@foadonis/actions'

export default class ChargeUserAction implements AsAction {
  handle(user: User) {
    // Your business logic
  }
}
```

## Running your action

Actions can be ran easily within your application using `actions.run()`.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import actions from '@foadonis/actions/services/main'
import ChargeUserAction from '#actions/charge_user_action'

await actions.run(ChargeUserAction, user)
```

## Dependency Injection

As your actions are resolved from the Container you can use [Dependency Injection](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/concepts/dependency-injection).

```ts [title="app/actions/charge_user_action.ts"] twoslash
// @noErrors
import { AsAction } from '@foadonis/actions'
import { inject } from '@adonisjs/core'
import User from '#models/user'
import StripeService from '#services/stripe_service'

@inject()
export default class ChargeUserAction implements AsAction {
  constructor(private stripe: StripeService) {}

  handle(user: User, amount: number) {
    await this.stripe.chargeCustomer(user.stripeId, amount)
  }
}
```
