Powercord allows you to emit client-side events directly from your backend.

It works by creating a "cord" between your server and your clients using either.

```tsx title="server.ts"
import powercord from '@foadonis/powercord'

// Broadcast to all connected clients
powercord.broadcast('toast', {
  title: 'Update available',
  content: 'A new update is available. Refresh your browser to benefit from latest features.',
})

// Broadcast to a specific client
router.get('/', ({ powercord }: HttpContext) => {
  powercord.send('log', { level: 'debug', message: 'console.log from the server!' })
})
```

```tsx title="client.ts"
import Powercord from '@foadonis/powercord/client'

Powercord.on('toast', ({ detail }) => {
  toast({
    title: detail.title,
    content: detail.content,
  })
})

Powercord.on('log', ({ detail }) => {
  console[detail.level](detail.message)
})

Powercord.start()
```
