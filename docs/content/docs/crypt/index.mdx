With Crypt you can safely store your credential in your repository and commit your environment variables files.

```sh
node ace crypt:set DB_PASSWORD mysupersecret
```

```dotenv title=".env"

## Features

✔ Directly integrate with [@adonisjs/env](https://github.com/adonisjs/env)  
✔ Stored directly in your `.env` files  
✔ Multi-environment support  
✔ Asymmetric cryptography for security and simplified worklow

## Why

### Leverage version control

Managing credentials across multiple environment can be tedious. By storing them encrypted, directly in your repository, you can leverage all your development workflow: Versionning, history, reviews, etc.

### Simplify secrets management

By using encrypted secrets stored in the repository you don't have to be scared to lose them anymore. You only have to take of a single secret: your private key.

### Asymmetric cryptography

With traditional secrets management allowing developers to edit production secrets also allow them to read them.
By using asymmetric cryptography, your developers can encrypt new secrets without being able to read existing one.

## How it works?

Crypt takes its inspiration from the [dotenvx](https://dotenvx.com/) library. It directly integrate with Adonis and more specifically [@adonisjs/env](https://github.com/adonisjs/env).

Each environment (development, staging, production, etc) has a generated keypair. The public key is stored in your repository for encrypting secrets and the private key is stored in a `.env.keys` file gitignored used to decrypt environment variables.

When starting your Adonis application, Crypt will override [@adonisjs/env](https://github.com/adonisjs/env) methods so every environment variable value prefixed with `encrypted:` will be decrypted automatically.
