title: Supscriptions
---

Subscriptions allow clients to receive updates in real time from the server. It works by exposing a Websocket endpoint allowing real-time communication.

This documentation might use some vocabulary you never had to deal with before:

<u>**Subscription**:</u>
<br />A subscription is a way to listen to real time events. In our case the clients will subscribe
to events coming from our backend.

<u>**Topic**:</u>
<br />A topic (also called channel) is an identifier used to subscribe to specific events. For
example clients that will subscribe to the topic `recipe:created` will only receive the events after
a recipe has been created.

<u>**PubSub**:</u>
<br />A PubSub system is a way to `Publish` and `Subscribe` to different topics. For example you
could use `pubsub.subscribe('recipe:created', callback)` to subscribe to the `recipe:created` topic
and `pubsub.publish('recipe:created', recipe)` to publish a created recipe.

documentation](https://typegraphql.com/docs/subscriptions.html)

## Configuration

First you will need to install the [`@graphql-yoga/subscription`](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga/tree/main) package.

```package-install
npm i @graphql-yoga/subscription
```

### PubSub instance

Let's now create a new `PubSub` instance that will be used by our GraphQL server to Subscribe and us to Publish.

```ts title="app/graphql/pubsub.ts"
import { createPubSub } from '@graphql-yoga/subscription'

export default createPubSub()
```

Register it in your GraphQL configuration:

```ts title="config/graphql.ts"
import pubsub from '#graphql/pubsub'
import { defineConfig } from '@foadonis/graphql'

export default defineConfig({
  pubSub: pubsub, // [!code highlight]
})
```

<Callout type='warn'>

In production, you might have multiple instances of your Adonis Application running behind a Load Balancer. Events published on one instance will not be broadcasted to other instances. Please check [Distributed PubSub documentation](#distributed-pubsub).

</Callout>

## Typing the PubSub

Our `PubSub` can already be used as it is but to have proper autocompletion and ensure we always forward proper data it is useful to define what are the different topics.

```ts title="app/graphql/pubsub.ts"
import { createPubSub } from '@graphql-yoga/subscription'

export default createPubSub<{
  'recipe:created': [Recipe]
  'recipe:deleted': [Recipe]
}>()
```

## Creating Subscriptions

Subscription resolvers are similar to [queries and mutation resolvers](./resolvers). In this example we will allow clients to receive real-time updates every time a new Recipe is created.

In a Resolver class, create a new method decorated with `@Subscription`.

### Single Topic

```ts title="app/graphql/resolvers/recipe_resolver.ts"
import { Resolver, Subscription } from '@foadonis/graphql'
import Recipe from '#graphql/recipe'

@Resolver()
export default class RecipeResolver {
  @Subscription({
    topics: 'recipe:created',
  })
  recipeCreated(@Root() payload: Recipe): Recipe {
    return payload
  }
}
```

### Multiple Topics

The `topics` option accepts a list of topics allowing you to subscribe to multiple topics.

```ts title="app/graphql/resolvers/recipe_resolver.ts"
import { Resolver, Subscription } from '@foadonis/graphql'
import Recipe from '#models/recipe'
import RecipeEvent from '#graphql/schemas/recipe_event'

@Resolver()
export default class RecipeResolver {
  @Subscription({
    topics: ['recipe:created', 'recipe:deleted'],
  })
  recipe(@Root() payload: RecipeEvent): RecipeEvent {
    return payload
  }
}
```

### Dynamic Topics

The topics option also accept a function that receive the context allowing you to dynamically subscribe to topics.

```ts title="app/graphql/resolvers/recipe_resolver.ts"
import { Resolver, Subscription } from '@foadonis/graphql'
import Recipe from '#models/recipe'
import RecipeEvent from '#graphql/schemas/recipe_event'

@Resolver()
export default class RecipeResolver {
  @Subscription({
    topics: ({ args }) => args.topic,
  })
  recipe(@Root() payload: RecipeEvent): RecipeEvent {
    return payload
  }
}
```

## Triggering Subscription Topics

Now that we have create our subscriptions, we can use the `PubSub` system to broadcast our events. This will usually be done inside a mutation but you can use it wherever you want inside your application.

### Inside a resolver

```ts title="app/graphql/resolvers/recipe_resolver.ts"
import { Resolver, Subscription } from '@foadonis/graphql'
import Recipe from '#models/recipe'
import RecipeEvent from '#graphql/schemas/recipe_event'
import pubsub from '#graphql/pubsub'

@Resolver()
export default class RecipeResolver {
  @Mutation(() => Recipe)
  createRecipe(): RecipeEvent {
    const recipe = Recipe.create()

    pubsub.publish('recipe:created', new RecipeEvent(recipe, 'created'))

    return recipe
  }
}
```

### Outside a resolver

```ts title="start/routes.ts"
import Recipe from '#models/recipe'
import RecipeEvent from '#graphql/schemas/recipe_event'
import pubsub from '#graphql/pubsub'

router.post('/api/recipes', () => {
  const recipe = Recipe.create()

  pubsub.publish('recipe:created', new RecipeEvent(recipe, 'created'))

  return recipe
})
```

## Distributed PubSub

When running multiple instances of your Adonis Application in a distributed environment you need a way to distribute the published event so every subscription will receive them.

<Callout>

This feature is not officially supported. In a near future you will be able to use your already configured [Adonis Redis](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/database/redis).

</Callout>

```package-install
npm install @graphql-yoga/redis-event-target ioredis
```

```ts title="app/graphql/pubsub.ts"
import { createPubSub } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { Redis } from 'ioredis'
import { createRedisEventTarget } from '@graphql-yoga/redis-event-target'

const publishClient = new Redis()
const subscribeClient = new Redis()

const eventTarget = createRedisEventTarget({
  publishClient,
  subscribeClient,
})

const pubSub = createPubSub({ eventTarget })
```
