description: Build GraphQL APIs powered by GraphQL Yoga

[GraphQL Yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server) is a **modern, lightweight** GraphQL server. It's fully open-source, optimized for developer experience, and built with flexibility in mind.

## Configuration

The Yoga driver is configured using the `driver` option with `drivers.yoga()` in your GraphQL configuration file. The configuration accepts all [GraphQL Yoga server options](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server/docs/configuration) except for `schema` (which is automatically provided).

```ts title="config/graphql.ts"
import env from '#start/env'
import { defineConfig, drivers } from '@foadonis/graphql'
import { useDisableIntrospection } from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-disable-introspection'

const isDevelopment = env.get('NODE_ENV') === 'development'

export default defineConfig({
  driver: drivers.yoga({
    // Yoga server configuration
    graphiql: isDevelopment,
    plugins: isDevelopment ? [] : [useDisableIntrospection()],
  }),
})
```

<Callout type="warn">

It is highly recommended **to disable the playground and introspection** in production for security reasons as it exposes the available operations of your application.

## Plugins

GraphQL Yoga supports a powerful plugin system that allows you to extend the server's functionality. You can add plugins to handle logging, error reporting, caching, and more.

```ts title="config/graphql.ts"
import { defineConfig, drivers } from '@foadonis/graphql'
import { useDisableIntrospection } from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-disable-introspection'

export default defineConfig({
  driver: drivers.yoga({
    plugins: [useDisableIntrospection()],
  }),
})
```
