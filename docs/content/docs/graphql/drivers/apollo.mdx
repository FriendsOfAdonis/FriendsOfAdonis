[Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server) is an **enterprise-oriented** GraphQL platform part of a large ecosystem. It is opinionated, feature-rich, optimized for large teams, production observability and schema governance.

## Configuration

The Apollo driver is configured using the `driver` option with `drivers.apollo()` in your GraphQL configuration file. The configuration accepts all [Apollo Server configuration options](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/apollo-server#constructor) except for `schema` (which is automatically provided).

```ts title="config/graphql.ts"
import env from '#start/env'
import { defineConfig, drivers } from '@foadonis/graphql'

const isDevelopment = env.get('NODE_ENV') === 'development'

export default defineConfig({
  driver: drivers.apollo({
    // Apollo server configuration
    introspection: isDevelopment,
    playground: isDevelopment,
  }),
})
```

<Callout type="warn">

It is highly recommended **to disable the playground and introspection** in production for security reasons as it exposes the available operations of your application.

## Plugins

Apollo Server supports a powerful plugin system that allows you to extend the server's functionality. You can add plugins to handle logging, error reporting, caching, and more.

```ts title="config/graphql.ts"
import { defineConfig, drivers } from '@foadonis/graphql'
import { ApolloServerPluginUsageReporting } from '@apollo/server/plugin/usageReporting'

export default defineConfig({
  driver: drivers.apollo({
    plugins: [
      ApolloServerPluginUsageReporting({
        sendVariableValues: { all: true },
      }),
    ],
  }),
})
```

You can find more information about Apollo Server plugins in the [official documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/plugins).
