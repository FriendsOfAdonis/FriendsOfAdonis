title: Validation
---

## Introduction

Inputs validation is an important piece in every backend application but is usually a source of trouble and result in a lot of boilerplate and duplicated code.

With `@foadonis/graphql` it is possible to have your validation schema as close as possible as your GraphQL schema (inputs, args, etc).

### Disclaimer

As of today, [VineJS](https://vinejs.dev/docs/introduction) is not supported out of the box and validation libraries that use decorators ([class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator), [joiful](https://github.com/joiful-ts/joiful)) are not maintained anymore and you might want to consider manual validation for now.

## class-validator

[class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator) is a validation library relying on decorators, allowing you to define your GraphQL schema and validation schema the same way.

```package-install
npm install class-validator
```

```ts title="config/graphql.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  // [...]
  validate: true,
})
```

We can now define our `CreateRecipeInput` schema with the following:

```ts
@InputType()
export class CreateRecipeInput {
  @Field()
  @Length(3, 30)
  declare title: string

  @Field({ nullable: true })
  @Length(30, 255)
  declare description?: string
}
```

And that's it! When this input is used in a resolver the data will be automatically validated:

```ts title="app/graphql/resolvers/recipe_resolver.ts"
@Resolver(() => Recipe)
class RecipeResolver {
  @Mutation(() => Recipe)
  createRecipe(@Arg('input') data: CreateRecipeInput) {
    return Recipe.create(data)
  }
}
```
