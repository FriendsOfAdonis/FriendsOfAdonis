title: Authorization

Authentication and Authorization are supported out of the box using [`@adonisjs/auth`](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/authentication/introduction) (authentication) and [`@adonisjs/bouncer`](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/security/authorization#authorization) (authorization).

You can find more information about Middlewares on the [Official TypeGraphQL
documentation](https://typegraphql.com/docs/authorization.html)

## Secure operations

You can secure your queries to only allow authenticated users to use them by using the `@Authorized` decorator.

```ts title="app/graphql/resolvers/recipe_resolver.ts"
import Recipe from '#models/recipe'
import { Resolver, Query, Mutation, Authorized } from '@foadonis/graphql'

@Resolver(Recipe)
class RecipeResolver {
  @Query(() => [Recipe])
  @Authorized() // [!code highlight]
  recipes() {
    // ...your logic
  }

  @Mutation(() => [Recipe])
  @Authorized() // [!code highlight]
  createRecipe() {
    // ...your logic
  }
}
```

The `Authorized` decorator accepts [Bouncer abilities](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/security/authorization#defining-abilities) allowing you to ensure your user respects specific requirements.

<Tabs items={["app/graphql/resolvers/recipe_resolver.ts", "app/abilities/main.ts"]}>

```ts tab="app/graphql/resolvers/recipe_resolver.ts"
import Recipe from '#models/recipe'
import { Resolver, Query, Authorized } from '@foadonis/graphql'
import abilities from '#abilities/main'

@Resolver(Recipe)
class RecipeResolver {
  @Query(() => [Recipe])
  @Authorized(abilities.isAdmin) // [!code highlight]
  recipes() {
    // ...your logic
  }
}
```

```ts tab="app/abilities/main.ts"
import { Bouncer } from '@adonisjs/bouncer'

const abilities = {
  isAdmin = Bouncer.ability((user) => user.isAdmin),
}

export default abilities
```

</Tabs>

<Callout>
  You can pass multiple abilities to `@Authorized`. The user will be authorized only if all of them
  pass.
</Callout>

## Secure objects

The `@Authorized` decorator also works on fields allowing you to protect only certain fields.
With the following example, only authenticated user can access the `fullName` and only admins can access `email`.

```ts title="app/models/user.ts"
import { ObjectType, Authorized } from '@foadonis/graphql'
import abilities from '#abilities/main'

@ObjectType()
export default class User {
  @Field()
  declare id: string

  @Field()
  @Authorized()
  declare fullName: string

  @Field()
  @Authorized(abilities.isAdmin)
  declare email: string
}
```

## Access authenticated User

### Using `@CurrentUser`

```ts title="app/graphql/resolvers/recipe_resolver.ts"
import Recipe from '#models/recipe'
import { Resolver, Query, CurrentUser } from '@foadonis/graphql'

@Resolver(Recipe)
class RecipeResolver {
  @Query(() => [Recipe])
  recipes(@CurrentUser() user: User) {
    // ...your logic
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warn">
  The `@CurrentUser` decorator makes your operation only available to authenticated users. If you
  still want to allow guest, you must use the context.
</Callout>

### Using the context

```ts title="app/graphql/resolvers/recipe_resolver.ts"
import Recipe from '#models/recipe'
import { HttpContext } from '@adonisjs/core/http'
import { Resolver, Query, Ctx } from '@foadonis/graphql'

@Resolver(Recipe)
class RecipeResolver {
  @Query(() => [Recipe])
  recipes(@Ctx() ctx: HttpContext) {
    const user = ctx.auth.getUserOrFail()
    // ...your logic
  }
}
```
