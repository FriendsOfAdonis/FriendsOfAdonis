Shopkeeper Stripe also provides support for [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/payments/checkout). Stripe Checkout takes the pain out of implementing custom pages to accept payments by providing a pre-built, hosted payment page.

The following documentation contains information on how to get started using Stripe Checkout with Shopkeeper. To learn more about Stripe Checkout, you should also consider reviewing [Stripe's own documentation on Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout).

## Product Checkout

You may perform a checkout for an existing product that has been created within your Stripe dashboard using the `checkout` method on a billable model. The `checkout` method will initiate a new Stripe Checkout session. By default, you're required to pass a Stripe Price ID:

```ts
router.get('/product-checkout', async ({ auth, response }) => {
  const user = auth.getUserOrFail()
  const checkout = await user.checkout('price_tshirt')

  response.redirect().status(303).toPath(checkout.session.url)
})
```

If needed, you may also specify a product quantity:

```ts
router.get('/product-checkout', async ({ auth, response }) => {
  const user = auth.getUserOrFail()
  const checkout = await user.checkout({ price_tshirt: 15 })

  response.redirect().status(303).toPath(checkout.session.url)
})
```

When a customer visits this route they will be redirected to Stripe's Checkout page. By default, when a user successfully completes or cancels a purchase they will be redirected to your `home` route location, but you may specify custom callback URLs using the `success_url` and `cancel_url` options:

```ts
router.get('/product-checkout', async ({ auth, response }) => {
  const user = auth.getUserOrFail()
  const checkout = await user.checkout(
    { price_tshirt: 15 },
    {
      success_url: route('checkout.success'),
      cancel_url: route('checkout.cancel'),
    }
  )

  response.redirect().status(303).toPath(checkout.session.url)
})
```

When defining your `success_url` checkout option, you may instruct Stripe to add the checkout session ID as a query string parameter when invoking your URL. To do so, add the literal string `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` to your `success_url` query string. Stripe will replace this placeholder with the actual checkout session ID:

```ts
router.get('/product-checkout', async ({ auth, response }) => {
  const user = auth.getUserOrFail()
  const checkout = await user.checkout(
    { price_tshirt: 15 },
    {
      success_url: route('checkout.success', { session_id: '{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}' }),
      cancel_url: route('checkout.cancel'),
    }
  )

  response.redirect().status(303).toPath(checkout.session.url)
})

router.get('/checkout-success', ({ request }) => {
  const qs = request.qs()
  const checkoutSession = await user.stripe.checkout.sessions.retrieve(qs.session_id)

  return view.render('checkout/success', { checkoutSession })
})
```

### Promotion codes

By default, Stripe Checkout does not allow [user redeemable promotion codes](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes). Luckily, there's an easy way to enable these for your Checkout page. To do so, you may invoke the `allowPromotionCodes` method:

```ts
router.get('/product-checkout', ({ response, auth }) => {
  const user = auth.getUserOrFail()
  const checkout = await user.allowPromotionCodes().checkout('price_tshirt')

  response.redirect().status(303).toPath(checkout.session.url)
})
```

## Single Charge Checkouts

You can also perform a simple charge for an ad-hoc product that has not been created in your Stripe dashboard. To do so you may use the `checkoutCharge` method on a billable model and pass it a chargeable amount, a product name, and an optional quantity. When a customer visits this route they will be redirected to Stripe's Checkout page:

```ts
router.get('/product-checkout', ({ auth }) => {
  const user = auth.getUserOrFail()
  const checkout = await user.allowPromotionCodes().checkoutCharge(1200, 'T-Shirt', 5)

  response.redirect().status(303).toPath(checkout.session.url)
})
```

<Callout type='warn'>

When using the `checkoutCharge` method, Stripe will always create a new product and price in your Stripe dashboard. Therefore, we recommend that you create the products up front in your Stripe dashboard and use the `checkout` method instead.

</Callout>

## Subscriptions Checkouts

<Callout type='warn'>

Using Stripe Checkout for subscriptions requires you to enable the `customer.subscription.created` webhook in your Stripe dashboard. This webhook will create the subscription record in your database and store all of the relevant subscription items.

</Callout>

You may also use Stripe Checkout to initiate subscriptions. After defining your subscription with Cashier's subscription builder methods, you may call the `checkout` method. When a customer visits this route they will be redirected to Stripe's Checkout page:

```ts
router.get('/subscription-checkout', ({ response, auth }) => {
  const user = auth.getUserOrFail()

  const checkout = await user.newSubscription('default', 'price_monthly').checkout({
    success_url: route('checkout.success'),
    cancel_url: route('checkout.cancel'),
  })

  response.redirect().status(303).toPath(checkout.session.url)
})
```

Of course, you can also enable promotion codes for subscription checkouts:

```ts
router.get('/subscription-checkout', ({ response, auth }) => {
  const user = auth.getUserOrFail()

  const checkout = await user
    .newSubscription('default', 'price_monthly')
    .allowPromotionCodes() // [!code highlight]
    .checkout({
      success_url: route('checkout.success'),
      cancel_url: route('checkout.cancel'),
    })

  response.redirect().status(303).toPath(checkout.session.url)
})
```

<Callout type='warn'>

Unfortunately Stripe Checkout does not support all subscription billing options when starting subscriptions. Using the `anchorBillingCycleOn` method on the subscription builder, setting proration behavior, or setting payment behavior will not have any effect during Stripe Checkout sessions. Please consult [the Stripe Checkout Session API documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create) to review which parameters are available.

</Callout>

### Stripe Checkout and Trial Periods

Of course, you can define a trial period when building a subscription that will be completed using Stripe Checkout:

```ts
const checkout = await user
  .newSubscription('default', 'price_monthly')
  .trialDays(3) // [!code highlight]
  .checkout()
```

However, the trial period must be at least 48 hours, which is the minimum amount of trial time supported by Stripe Checkout.

### Subscriptions and Webhooks

Remember, Stripe and Shopkeeper update subscription statuses via webhooks, so there's a possibility a subscription might not yet be active when the customer returns to the application after entering their payment information. To handle this scenario, you may wish to display a message informing the user that their payment or subscription is pending.

## Collecting Tax IDs

Checkout also supports collecting a customer's Tax ID. To enable this on a checkout session, invoke the `collectTaxIds` method when creating the session:

```ts
const checkout = await user.collectTaxIds().checkout('price_tshirt')
```

When this method is invoked, a new checkbox will be available to the customer that allows them to indicate if they're purchasing as a company. If so, they will have the opportunity to provide their Tax ID number.

<Callout>

If you have already configured [automatic tax collection](#tax-configuration) in your application's service provider then this feature will be enabled automatically and there is no need to invoke the `collectTaxIds` method.

</Callout>

## Guest Checkouts

Using the `Checkout.guest` method, you may initiate checkout sessions for guests of your application that do not have an "account":

```ts
import { Checkout } from '@foadonis/shopkeeper'

router.get('/product-checkout', ({ response }) => {
  const checkout = await Checkout.guest().create('default', 'price_monthly', {
    success_url: route('checkout.success'),
    cancel_url: route('checkout.cancel'),
  })

  response.redirect().status(303).toPath(checkout.session.url)
})
```

Similarly to when creating checkout sessions for existing users, you may utilize additional methods available on the `CheckoutBuilder` instance to customize the guest checkout session:

```ts
import { Checkout } from '@foadonis/shopkeeper'

router.get('/product-checkout', ({ response }) => {
  const checkout = await Checkout.guest()
    .withPromotionCode('promo-code')
    .create('default', 'price_monthly', {
      success_url: route('checkout.success'),
      cancel_url: route('checkout.cancel'),
    })

  response.redirect().status(303).toPath(checkout.session.url)
})
```

After a guest checkout has been completed, Stripe can dispatch a `checkout.session.completed` webhook event, so make sure to [configure your Stripe webhook](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) to actually send this event to your application. Once the webhook has been enabled within the Stripe dashboard, you may [handle the webhook with Cashier](./webhooks). The object contained in the webhook payload will be a [`checkout` object](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/object) that you may inspect in order to fulfill your customer's order.
