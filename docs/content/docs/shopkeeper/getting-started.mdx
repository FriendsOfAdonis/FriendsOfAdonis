## Installation

Install and configure the package using the following command :

```sh
node ace add @foadonis/shopkeeper
```

<ConfigurationSteps pkg="@foadonis/shopkeeper" providers={['shopkeeper']} config="shopkeeper" />

### Migrations

Shopkeeper comes with a set of migrations to add serveral columns to your `users` table, a new `subscriptions` table to hold all of your customer's subscriptions and a `subscription_items` table for subscriptions with multiple prices.

You can run the migration with:

```sh
node ace migrations:run
```

Lastly, to ensure Shopkeeper properly handles all Stripe events, remember to [configure Shopkeeper's webhook handling](./webhooks).

## Configuration

### Billable Model

Before using Shopkeeper, add the `Billable` mixin to your billable model definition. Typically, this will be the `User` model. This trait provides various methods to allow you to perform common billing tasks, such as creating subscriptions, applying coupons, and updating payment method information:

```ts title="app/models/user.ts"
import { compose } from '@adonisjs/core/helpers'
import { BaseModel } from '@adonisjs/lucid/orm'
import { Billable } from '@foadonis/shopkeeper/mixins'

export default class User extends compose(BaseModel, Billable) {}
```

In your Shopkeeper configuration file, define your User as the Customer model:

```ts
// title: config/shopkeeper.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@foadonis/shopkeeper'

export default defineConfig({
  customerModel: () => import('#models/user')
  ...
})
```

<Callout>

When using a model with a different name than `User`, make sure to change the table name in the generated migration.

</Callout>

### API Keys

Next, you should configure your Stripe API keys in your application's `.env` file. You can retrieve your Stripe API keys from the [Stripe control panel](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/developers):

```ini title=".env"
STRIPE_KEY=your-stripe-key
STRIPE_SECRET=your-stripe-secret
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-stripe-webhook-secret
```

<Callout type="warn">

In production environment the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable is mandatory as it secures the Stripe webhook endpoint.

</Callout>

## Your first Checkout

The easiest way to get started with Stripe is by using the [https://stripe.com/payments/checkout](Stripe Checkout) feature.

### Create a price

To start selling you must create a new price in Stripe. want to try the implementation

If you have the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli) you can simply run the following command.

````bash
stripe prices create  \
  --currency=usd \
  --unit-amount=1000 \
  -d "recurring[interval]"=month \
  -d "product_data[name]"="Gold Plan"```
````

### Redirect to the Checkout

Let's now create a route to redirect our user to the Stripe Checkout page for the price we just created.

```ts title="start/routes.ts"
router.get('/checkout', ({ auth }) => {
  const user = await auth.getUserOrFail()
  const checkout = await user.checkout('price_xxxxxxx')

  response.redirect(303).toPath(checkout.session.url)
})
```

### Handle redirect

When a customer visits this route they will be redirected to Stripe's Checkout page. By default, when a user successfully completes or cancels a purchase they will be redirected to your `home` route location, but you may specify custom callback URLs using the `success_url` and `cancel_url` options:

```ts
router.get('/', async ({ auth, response }) => {
  const user = auth.getUserOrFail()
  const checkout = await user.checkout('price_xxxxxxx', {
    success_url: route('checkout.success'),
    cancel_url: route('checkout.cancel'),
  })

  response.redirect().status(303).toPath(checkout.session.url)
})

router
  .get('/success', async ({ view }) => {
    return view.render('checkout/success')
  })
  .as('checkout.success')

router
  .get('/cancel', async ({ view }) => {
    return view.render('checkout/cancel')
  })
  .as('checkout.cancel')
```

Congratulation, you can now accept money and get your first customers!
