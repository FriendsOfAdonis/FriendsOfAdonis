## Introduction

Once you deploy in production your application, it becomes a black box. Errors and performance issues might occur and you will never know unless you actively monitor logs or receive emails from your users complaining.

That's where [Sentry](https://sentry.io) comes in.

## What is Sentry

[Sentry](https://sentry.io) is a SaaS platform that helps track errors and performance issues in your app. It catches crashes, logs API errors, and monitors slow requests, making debugging easier.

It integrates nicely with [Github](https://github.com), [Slack](https://slack.com) and [Linear](https://linear.app) and it became a must have on all of my projects.

  Did you know that [Sentry](https://sentry.io) is Open-Source? You can even [self-host the platform
  for free](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/).

## Getting Started

### Install the Sentry SDK

Run the following command with your favorite package manager to add the Sentry Node SDK to your application:

```package-install
npm install @sentry/node
```

### Configure Sentry

Sentry has a feature called "auto-instrumentation" that will automatically enable and configure integrations based on your imports. For this to work it has to be the initialized at the very start of your application.

Let's create a file called `instrument.ts` at the root of our project and initialize Sentry SDK in it:

```ts [title="instrument.ts"] twoslash
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node'

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '<your-dsn>',
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // You might want to reduce this value in production
})
```

<Callout>
  You get your [Sentry DSN](https://docs.sentry.io/concepts/key-terms/dsn-explainer/) when creating
  a new project or in the settings of an existing one.
</Callout>

#### Configure Knex integration (optional)

[Knex](https://knexjs.org/) is the underlying library used by [Lucid ORM](https://lucid.adonisjs.com/) to interact with your database. Which means we can use the [Knex integration](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/node/configuration/integrations/knex/) to monitor our database queries!

```ts [title="instrument.ts"] twoslash
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node'

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '<your-dsn>',
  integrations: [Sentry.knexIntegration()], // [!code ++]
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
})
```

#### Initialize Sentry

Let's now import our `instrument.ts` file at the start of our application. To make sure "auto-instrumentation" works correctly we will do it directly inside our `bin/server.ts` file.

```ts [title="bin/server.ts"]
import '../instrument.js' // [!code focus]
import 'reflect-metadata'
import { Ignitor, prettyPrintError } from '@adonisjs/core'

/**
 * URL to the application root. AdonisJS need it to resolve
 * paths to file and directories for scaffolding commands
 */
const APP_ROOT = new URL('../', import.meta.url)
```

### Capture exceptions

Let's send our first exception to Sentry. After hitting the route `/` you should see a new issue appearing in your dashboard.

```ts [title="start/routes.ts"] twoslash
import router from '@adonisjs/core/services/router'
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node'

router.get('/', async () => {
  Sentry.captureException(new Error('Hello from Adonis'))
  return 'It works!'
})
```

This is not great as we have to manually capture the exception. Let's change this by directly throwing an error.

```ts [title="start/routes.ts"] twoslash
import router from '@adonisjs/core/services/router'
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node'

router.get('/', async () => {
  Sentry.captureException(new Error('Hello from Adonis')) // [!code --]
  throw new Error('Hello again from Adonis') // [!code ++]
  return 'It works!'
})
```

If you hit the route again, you will not see any issue appearing on your dashboard. This is because Adonis automatically handles exceptions for us.
Luckily, we can use the `report` method on the `HttpExceptionHandler` to capture exceptions.

```ts [title="app/exceptions/handler.ts"] twoslash
// @noErrors
import app from '@adonisjs/core/services/app'
import { HttpContext, ExceptionHandler } from '@adonisjs/core/http'
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node'

export default class HttpExceptionHandler extends ExceptionHandler {
  async report(error: unknown, ctx: HttpContext) {
    Sentry.captureException(error) // [!code ++]
    return super.report(error, ctx)
  }
}
```

Now errors thrown in your routes will be automatically captured and sent to Sentry!

### Adding User context (optional)

There are a lot of reasons why you would want to attach errors to users. For example, prioritizing issues based on the amount of affected users.

To do this we will create a `SilentAuthMiddleware` that will authenticate our users even if an auth guard is not configured.

<Callout>Depending on your starter kit, this middleware might already exist.</Callout>

```ts [title="app/middleware/silent_auth_middleware.ts"] twoslash
// @noErrors
import type { HttpContext } from '@adonisjs/core/http'
import type { NextFn } from '@adonisjs/core/types/http'
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node'

export default class SilentAuthMiddleware {
  async handle(ctx: HttpContext, next: NextFn) {
    await ctx.auth.check()

    if (ctx.auth.user) {
      const user = ctx.auth.user
      Sentry.setUser({
        id: user.id,
        email: user.email,
      })
    }

    return next()
  }
}
```

Let's now configure our middleware in `start/kernel.ts`. Make sure that it is added after the `initialize_auth_middleware`.

```ts [title="start/kernel.ts"]
router.use([
  () => import('@adonisjs/core/bodyparser_middleware'),
  () => import('@adonisjs/auth/initialize_auth_middleware'),
  () => import('#middleware/silent_auth_middleware'), // [!code ++]
  () => import('#middleware/initialize_bouncer_middleware'),
])
```

## Conclusion

Setting up Sentry in your AdonisJS app takes few minutes and can save you a ton of time:

- Monitor errors happening in your application and prioritize them
- Track performance issues and identify the source of the problem
- Identify slow database queries thanks to the Knex integration

Now, youâ€™ll always have visibility into whatâ€™s happening in production. ðŸš€
